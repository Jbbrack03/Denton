# Sudachi Multiplayer Performance Benchmarking Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive performance benchmarking strategy for the Sudachi multiplayer system, designed to validate the performance targets specified in PRD Section 7.1.

## Performance Targets (from PRD 7.1)

### Connection Establishment
- Initial connection: < 3 seconds (Model A with good network)
- P2P negotiation: < 5 seconds including fallback decision
- Ad-hoc discovery: < 2 seconds for local network scan
- Reconnection after disconnect: < 1 second

### Latency Targets
- Local Ad-hoc (Model B): < 5ms additional overhead
- P2P Direct (Model A): < 20ms additional overhead
- Relay Server (Model A): < 50ms additional overhead
- Maximum jitter: < 10ms for stable connections

### Throughput Requirements
- Minimum bandwidth: 256 Kbps per player
- Recommended bandwidth: 1 Mbps per player
- Maximum packet size: 1400 bytes (MTU safe)
- Packet frequency: Up to 60 Hz for real-time games

### Scalability Targets
- Room Server: 100,000 concurrent connections per instance
- Relay Server: 10,000 concurrent sessions per instance
- Maximum players per session: 8 (game dependent)
- Room list query: < 100ms response time

## Benchmark Categories

### 1. Connection Establishment Benchmarks
- **P2P Connection Setup**: Time from initiation to established connection
- **Relay Fallback**: Time for P2P failure detection and relay establishment
- **Ad-hoc Discovery**: Time to discover and connect to local sessions
- **Reconnection Speed**: Time to re-establish broken connections

### 2. Latency Measurement Benchmarks
- **Round-trip Time**: Measure latency overhead in each networking mode
- **Jitter Analysis**: Statistical analysis of latency variation
- **Packet Processing Latency**: Time from receive to game delivery

### 3. Throughput and Bandwidth Benchmarks
- **Packet Rate**: Validate 60Hz packet processing capability
- **Bandwidth Utilization**: Test sustained throughput at target rates
- **Concurrent Player Scaling**: Performance with increasing player counts

### 4. Component Performance Benchmarks
- **HLE Interface**: nn::ldn service call performance
- **Configuration System**: Settings validation and loading performance
- **Error Handling**: Error detection and recovery performance

### 5. Network Condition Impact Benchmarks
- **Simulated Network Conditions**: Performance under packet loss, latency, jitter
- **Platform-Specific Performance**: Windows vs Android performance comparison
- **Resource Constraint Testing**: Performance under CPU/memory pressure

### 6. Memory and Scalability Benchmarks
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption patterns under load
- **Thread Safety**: Performance of concurrent operations
- **Resource Cleanup**: Performance of connection teardown

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Each benchmark includes clear pass/fail criteria based on PRD requirements:

- **PASS**: Performance meets or exceeds PRD targets
- **MARGINAL**: Performance within 10% of target (requires optimization)
- **FAIL**: Performance exceeds target by more than 10%

## Implementation Architecture

- **Google Benchmark Framework**: For precise timing measurements
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Controllable test environment
- **Docker Test Environment**: Reproducible network conditions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Multiple runs with statistical validation
- **CI Integration**: Automated performance regression detection

## Usage

```bash
# Run all performance benchmarks
./sudachi_multiplayer_benchmarks

# Run specific benchmark category
./sudachi_multiplayer_benchmarks --benchmark_filter="ConnectionEstablishment.*"

# Generate performance report
./sudachi_multiplayer_benchmarks --benchmark_format=json --benchmark_out=performance_report.json
```

## Reporting

Performance results are automatically:
- Compared against PRD targets
- Tracked for performance regressions
- Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Documented in performance reports
