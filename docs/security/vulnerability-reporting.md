## Security Best Practices for Researchers

### Testing Environment Setup

#### Local Testing
```bash
# Set up local Sudachi multiplayer environment
git clone https://github.com/sudachi-emulator/sudachi.git
cd sudachi
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_MULTIPLAYER=ON -DENABLE_MULTIPLAYER_TESTS=ON
make -j$(nproc)

# Use test servers instead of production
export SUDACHI_ROOM_SERVER_URL="ws://localhost:3000"
export SUDACHI_RELAY_SERVER_URL="localhost:7777"
```

#### Docker Test Environment
```bash
# Use our Docker test environment
git clone https://github.com/sudachi-emulator/sudachi-multiplayer-docker.git
cd sudachi-multiplayer-docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# All services will be available on localhost with non-standard ports
```

### Ethical Testing Guidelines

#### Network Testing
```bash
# Use rate limiting to avoid overwhelming servers
for i in {1..10}; do
    curl -X POST "https://room.sudachi.org/api/test" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"test": "payload"}' \
         --max-time 10
    sleep 2  # Be respectful of server resources
done
```

#### Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test only with your own accounts
# Never attempt to access other users' data
# Use test accounts specifically created for security testing
```
