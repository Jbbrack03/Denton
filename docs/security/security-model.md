# Sudachi Multiplayer Security Model

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security model implemented in Sudachi Multiplayer, covering threat modeling, security controls, and defensive mechanisms for both Internet (Model A) and Offline (Model B) multiplayer modes.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls protect against various attack vectors:
- Network-level protections (firewalls, rate limiting)
- Application-level validation (input sanitization, packet inspection)  
- Platform-level security (OS permissions, encryption)
- User-level controls (privacy settings, blocking)

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
No implicit trust between components:
- All communications are validated and authenticated
- Least privilege access for all components
- Continuous monitoring and verification

### 3. Privacy by Design
User privacy is built into the system architecture:
- Minimal data collection and retention
- User control over personal information sharing
- Anonymous gameplay options available

## Threat Model

### Internet Multiplayer (Model A) Threats

#### 1. Network-Level Attacks

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**
- **Risk**: Eavesdropping, data manipulation, session hijacking
- **Mitigation**: TLS encryption, certificate pinning, connection integrity checks
- **Impact**: High (data compromise, session takeover)

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
- **Risk**: Service unavailability, resource exhaustion
- **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, connection limits, geographic distribution
- **Impact**: Medium (service disruption)

**NAT Traversal Exploitation**
- **Risk**: Bypassing firewalls, unauthorized network access
- **Mitigation**: Restricted port ranges, UPnP validation, fallback limitations
- **Impact**: Medium (network security bypass)

#### 2. Application-Level Attacks

**Packet Injection/Manipulation**
- **Risk**: Game state corruption, cheating, crashes
- **Mitigation**: Cryptographic signatures, sequence validation, checksum verification
- **Impact**: High (game integrity compromise)

**Session Hijacking**
- **Risk**: Unauthorized control of multiplayer sessions
- **Mitigation**: Session tokens, IP binding, timeout enforcement
- **Impact**: High (account/session takeover)

**Input Validation Bypass**
- **Risk**: Buffer overflows, code injection, crashes
- **Mitigation**: Strict input validation, sanitization, buffer bounds checking
- **Impact**: Critical (system compromise)

## Security Controls

### 1. Network Security Layer

The security framework includes comprehensive input validation, rate limiting, and DDoS protection:

- **Packet Validation**: All network packets undergo size, header, and content validation
- **JSON Message Validation**: Schema validation for all JSON communications
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm with configurable limits
- **Connection Limits**: Per-IP and global connection restrictions
- **IP Blacklisting**: Automatic blocking of suspicious sources

### 2. Encryption and Data Protection

#### Model A Encryption
- **WebSocket Communications**: TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy
- **P2P Data**: libp2p Noise protocol with ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Relay Communications**: TLS with client certificate authentication
- **Session Tokens**: JWT with RS256 signatures

#### Model B Encryption  
- **Wi-Fi Direct**: WPA3-SAE or WPA2-PSK with AES-256
- **Mobile Hotspot**: WPA3 Personal with randomized passwords
- **Application Data**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for game packets

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Internet Mode**: OAuth2/JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **Offline Mode**: Pre-shared keys derived from game save data
- **Device Authentication**: Hardware-backed attestation where available
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular permission system for session management

### 4. Privacy Controls

#### Data Minimization
- **Collect Only**: Game state, connection metadata, error reports
- **No Collection**: Personal identifiers, device fingerprints, location data
- **Retention**: 7 days for connection logs, 30 days for error reports

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Intrusion Detection

The system includes comprehensive monitoring for:
- **Port Scanning Detection**: Automated detection and blocking
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Progressive enforcement with temporary bans
- **Malformed Packet Detection**: Immediate connection termination
- **Authentication Failure Monitoring**: Progressive timeout increases

### 2. Logging and Auditing
- **Security Events**: Authentication failures, blocked connections, rate limit violations
- **Access Logs**: Session creation/destruction, player join/leave events  
- **Error Logs**: Protocol violations, malformed packets, encryption failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Connection latency, bandwidth usage, error rates

## Compliance and Standards

### OWASP Top 10 Compliance
- ✅ **A01 Broken Access Control**: Role-based permissions, session validation
- ✅ **A02 Cryptographic Failures**: TLS 1.3, proper key management
- ✅ **A03 Injection**: Input validation, parameterized queries
- ✅ **A04 Insecure Design**: Threat modeling, security by design
- ✅ **A05 Security Misconfiguration**: Secure defaults, hardening guides
- ✅ **A06 Vulnerable Components**: Dependency scanning, update management
- ✅ **A07 Authentication Failures**: Multi-factor auth, session management
- ✅ **A08 Software Integrity**: Code signing, secure distribution
- ✅ **A09 Logging Failures**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring
- ✅ **A10 SSRF**: Request validation, allowlist filtering

### Regulatory Compliance

#### GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Data Processing**: Lawful basis documented for all data collection
- **User Rights**: Data access, rectification, erasure, portability
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, access controls, retention limits
- **Breach Notification**: 72-hour reporting requirements

#### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
- **Age Verification**: Parental consent for users under 13
- **Data Collection**: Minimal data collection from children
- **Parental Controls**: Account oversight and session restrictions

## Vulnerability Management

### Secure Development Lifecycle

- **Static Analysis**: Automated scanning for common vulnerabilities
- **Peer Review**: Manual code review with security focus
- **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party library vulnerability assessment
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

### Response Timeline
- **Critical**: 24 hours for patch, immediate hotfix deployment
- **High**: 7 days for patch, next release cycle
- **Medium**: 30 days for patch, planned release
- **Low**: 90 days for fix, maintenance release

## Security Configuration

### Default Security Settings

The system ships with secure defaults:
- **TLS 1.3** encryption for all communications
- **Rate limiting** enabled with conservative limits
- **Connection limits** to prevent resource exhaustion
- **DDoS protection** with automatic blacklisting
- **Input validation** enabled for all data processing

### Hardening Guidelines

#### Network Configuration
- Enable firewall with strict ingress rules
- Use non-default ports where possible
- Implement proper NAT/firewall traversal
- Configure rate limiting on all endpoints

#### Application Configuration  
- Enable all input validation checks
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper session timeout
- Configure comprehensive logging

#### Platform Configuration
- Keep OS and dependencies updated
- Use platform security features (ASLR, DEP, etc.)
- Configure appropriate file permissions
- Enable platform-specific protections
