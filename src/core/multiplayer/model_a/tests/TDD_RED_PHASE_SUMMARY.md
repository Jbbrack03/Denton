# TDD Red Phase: Relay Client Implementation Tests

## Overview

This document summarizes the failing tests created for the Relay Client implementation following Test-Driven Development (TDD) red phase methodology. All tests are designed to fail initially since the RelayClient implementation doesn't exist yet.

## Files Created

### 1. Test Files

#### `/tests/test_relay_protocol.cpp`
**Purpose**: Tests for relay protocol header serialization/deserialization
**Test Cases**: 13 comprehensive test cases covering:
- RelayHeader struct layout and size validation (12 bytes per PRD)
- Header serialization with valid data and maximum payload size
- Header deserialization with valid/invalid data
- Data and control message creation
- Header and message validation
- Protocol limits and constants
- Endianness handling (little-endian)
- Protocol flag definitions

**Key Features**:
- Tests the 12-byte RelayHeader struct from PRD Section 3.4
- Validates little-endian serialization for cross-platform compatibility
- Covers edge cases and error conditions
- All tests use `ASSERT_TRUE(false)` to fail until implementation exists

#### `/tests/test_relay_client.cpp`
**Purpose**: Tests for core relay client functionality
**Test Cases**: 10 comprehensive test cases covering:
- Construction and initialization
- Successful connection with JWT authentication
- Connection failure handling
- Session creation and joining
- Data forwarding through relay
- Bandwidth limiting (10 Mbps per PRD)
- P2P to relay fallback mechanism
- Relay server failover
- Latency measurement (< 50ms per PRD)
- Concurrent data transmission and thread safety
- Connection cleanup and resource management
- Error handling and recovery

**Key Features**:
- Uses Google Mock for dependency injection
- Covers all requirements from PRD Section 3.4
- Tests bandwidth limiting (10 Mbps limit)
- Tests latency requirements (< 50ms overhead)
- All tests use `ASSERT_TRUE(false)` to fail until implementation exists

#### `/tests/mock_relay_connection.h`
**Purpose**: Mock interfaces for relay components
**Mock Classes**: 5 comprehensive mock interfaces:
- `MockRelayConnection`: Core relay connection functionality
- `MockRelayProtocolHandler`: Protocol serialization/deserialization
- `MockBandwidthLimiter`: Bandwidth limiting functionality
- `MockP2PConnection`: P2P connection for fallback testing
- `MockRelayServerSelector`: Server discovery and selection

**Key Features**:
- Uses Google Mock framework
- Comprehensive method coverage for testing
- Supports all relay client testing scenarios

### 2. Implementation Headers (Stubs)

#### `/relay_protocol.h`
**Purpose**: Header-only definitions for relay protocol
**Contains**:
- `RelayHeader` struct (12 bytes, packed)
- `RelayProtocol` class declaration (methods not implemented)
- Static assertion for header size validation

**Key Features**:
- Exactly 12 bytes as per PRD specification
- Packed structure for binary protocol compatibility
- Methods declared but not implemented (linker errors expected)

#### `/relay_client.h`
**Purpose**: Header-only definitions for relay client
**Contains**:
- `RelayClient` class declaration
- `ConnectionState` enum
- Method signatures for all required functionality

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive API covering all PRD requirements
- Methods declared but not implemented (linker errors expected)
- Clear documentation of intended functionality

### 3. Verification Files

#### `/tests/verify_relay_tests_red_phase.cpp`
**Purpose**: Verification script to confirm TDD red phase
**Demonstrates**:
- RelayHeader struct size validation
- Confirmation that classes exist but methods aren't implemented
- Summary of test coverage and PRD requirements

#### `/tests/demonstrate_test_failures.cpp`
**Purpose**: Simple demonstration of test failure scenarios
**Shows**:
- Header compilation succeeds
- Method calls would fail with linker errors
- Test explicit failure design

## Test Strategy Coverage

### Requirements from PRD Section 3.4

✅ **RelayHeader Structure (12 bytes)**
- Tests validate exact 12-byte structure
- Tests field alignment and offsets
- Tests little-endian serialization

✅ **Session-based Routing**
- Tests session creation and joining
- Tests session token validation
- Tests session management lifecycle

✅ **10 Mbps Bandwidth Limit**
- Tests bandwidth limiter functionality
- Tests rate limiting enforcement
- Tests concurrent transmission limits

✅ **JWT Authentication**
- Tests authentication flow
- Tests token handling
- Tests authentication failure scenarios

✅ **< 50ms Latency Overhead**
- Tests latency measurement
- Tests latency monitoring
- Tests performance requirements

✅ **P2P to Relay Fallback**
- Tests NAT traversal failure detection
- Tests automatic fallback mechanism
- Tests connection type reporting

### Testing Principles (FIRST)

✅ **Fast**: Tests use mocks and avoid network I/O
✅ **Independent**: Each test can run in isolation
✅ **Repeatable**: Deterministic test design with no randomness
✅ **Self-validating**: Clear pass/fail criteria with descriptive assertions
✅ **Timely**: Tests written before implementation (red phase)

## Current Status: RED PHASE ✓

### What Works
- All test files compile successfully
- Header files provide necessary type definitions
- Mock interfaces are complete and functional
- RelayHeader struct meets PRD size requirements

### What Fails (As Expected)
- All test cases explicitly fail with `ASSERT_TRUE(false)`
- Method calls would cause linker errors
- RelayClient constructor not implemented
- RelayProtocol methods not implemented

### Next Steps (GREEN PHASE)
1. Implement `RelayProtocol` class methods
2. Implement `RelayClient` class constructor and methods
3. Implement bandwidth limiting functionality
4. Implement server selection and failover
5. Run tests to verify they pass
6. Move to REFACTOR phase for optimization

## Build Integration

The test files have been integrated into the CMake build system:
- Added to `/tests/CMakeLists.txt`
- Configured to build with Google Test framework
- Ready for continuous integration testing

## Test Execution

When the full build system is available, tests can be run with:
```bash
ctest -R "relay" --output-on-failure
```

Until then, individual verification can be done with the provided demonstration scripts.
